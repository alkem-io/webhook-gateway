  title: Login Backoff Webhook Endpoints
  description: |
    Login brute force protection endpoints for the Alkemio Webhook Gateway.

    Two endpoints handle the login backoff lifecycle:
    - **before-login**: Called before each login attempt to check lockout status and increment counters.
    - **after-login**: Called after successful password authentication to reset counters.

    The before-login endpoint is designed to be called by any integration layer
    (Kratos webhook, reverse proxy, or application server) that can provide the
    identifier and client IP at credential submission time.

    The after-login endpoint is called by a Kratos after-login webhook hook
    configured with a Jsonnet template that extracts identity and IP information.

      summary: Check lockout status and increment attempt counters
      description: |
        Called before each login attempt. Increments the failed attempt counter
        for the provided identifier and/or client IP, then checks whether either
        has exceeded the configured threshold.

        If locked out, returns HTTP 403 with lockout details.
        If allowed, returns HTTP 200 with current attempt counts.

        Fail-open: If Redis is unavailable, returns HTTP 200 (login allowed)
        and logs a warning.

        At least one of `identifier` or `client_ip` should be provided.
        If neither is present, the request is skipped (allowed) with a warning.
